# Socket Messenger
Minecraft plugin for Bukkit/Spigot - BungeeCord communication trough sockets.

#### The plugin is currently in alpha stage. Still needs testing to find out bugs.

This plugin enables you to send data between your BungeeCord server and Bukkit/Spigot server underneath it.
The plugin uses sockets to send data, which adds more features over the default messaging:

- Easier use
- No need for online players
- Ability to send full Objects

## How to use

#### Attention - This plugin requires an open port avaliable on the machine, if you use a hosting provider, contact them about using other ports alongside the one for the server.

#### Attention - This plugin is compiled using Java 8. IT will not work if your machine does not have Java 8 installed!!! I will consider making a version without Java 8 in the near future.

Using the plugin is simple. Download the latest builds from http://adf.ly/1S1Zjl. Drag the SocketMessengerBukkit.jar to all
Spigot/Bukkit servers's plugin folders, on which you wish to use the plugin on. Drag the SocketMessengerBungee.jar
to the BungeeCord server's plugins folder. After running the plugin you can configur the port to use in the plugins config.
