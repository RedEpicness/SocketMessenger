# Socket Messenger
Minecraft plugin for Bukkit/Spigot - BungeeCord communication trough sockets.

## I HAVE ABANDONED THIS PROJECT FOR NOW, IN FAVOR OF https://github.com/RedEpicness/redis-messenger AS IT IS OFFERS MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH REDIS OVER THE RAW SOCKET, IF I GET MORE REQUESTS TO UPDATE THIS, I WILL RETURN TO IT.

#### The plugin is currently in alpha stage. Still needs testing to find out bugs.

This plugin enables you to send data between your BungeeCord server and Bukkit/Spigot server underneath it.
The plugin uses sockets to send data, which adds more features over the default messaging:

- Easier use
- No need for online players
- Ability to send full Objects

**Attention - This plugin requires an open port avaliable on the machine, if you use a hosting provider, contact them about using other ports alongside the one for the server.**

**Attention - This plugin is compiled using Java 8. IT will not work if your machine does not have Java 8 installed!!! I will consider making a version without Java 8 in the near future.**

Check how to [install, configure and use the plugin here](https://github.com/RedEpicness/SocketMessenger/wiki).

**If You have any problems or suggestions, contact me via the spigot forums!**
